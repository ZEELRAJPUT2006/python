q.1 explain shell types in Linux
= bourn shell :- oldest, simple, support basic script, linited iteractive features
= bash shell :- common, command history, tab completation, advance scripting
= c shell :- c for syntax, history mechanism, job control
= korn shell :- combine of bourn shell and c shell, faster, support airthmethic operation
= z shell :- superset of bash shell, auto correction, thems & pluging
= fish shell :- user friendly, auto-suggestion, syntax handling

q.2 file types in Linux
= regular file :- store normal data
= directory :- contain file and other directory
= character device :- device file that transfer the data character by character
= block device :- device transfer in a block
= socket :- use intel process communication
= named pipe :- one way communication between process
= symbolic link :- shortcut to point another directory

q.3 directory structure and FHS
= Linux support hierarchical directory structure starting from the root, filesystem hierarchical standard define the purpose of each directory so that all Linux system stay consist
= / :- root of the filesystem
= /bin :- basic user command
= /sbin :- system administrator command
= /home :- user home directory
= /root :- system home directory
= /dev :- device directory
= /var :- variable data like logs
= /etc :- configuration file
= /tmp :- temporary file
= /usr :- user information, documentation, and library
= /boot :- boot loader file and kernel

q.4 process command
= process command are command used in operating system to manage and execution of process
= ps :- display the current running process
= fg :- bring job of background in foreground
= bg :- resume job in background
= kill :- terminate the process with their pid
= sleep :- stop the execution for some time

q.5 at,batch,crontab command
= at :- run a job once at specific time
= batch :- similar to at, run when system load is low
= crontab :- used to schedule a job rapidally at interval time

q.6 explain $(())
= $() :- command substruction :- command execute and return as an output
  ex = $(date)
= $(()) :- support all arithmetic operation
  ex = $((5+3))

q.7 regular expression
= regular expression are special pattern to match, insert and manipulate the text file and input stream
= regular expression used with Linux commands like grep, sed, process
= there are two types
 1. basic regular expression
 = used with grep command , follow ., *, ^, $, []
 2. extended regular expression
 = used with egrep command , follow ?, +, (), |

= options with regular expression:
1 . :- match one character 
2 * :- match one or more occurrence
3 ^word :- line start with word
4 word$ :- line end with word
5 [a,b,c] :- match a,b and c
6 [0-9] :- match any digit

q.8 grep command:
= grep command is stands for global regular expression print
= grep command is used to search text pattern in input or text file
= it support regular expression and match the pattern
= options with grep:
1. -i :- ignore case
2. -v :- do not contain matching pattern
3. -c :- count the number of line
4. -n :-display the number of matching line
5. l :- display the filename which is matched

q.9 egrep
= egrep is stands for extended global regular expression
= works like grep -E
= it support the . ,* ,^, $,[]
= example egrep "cat|dog" animal.txt

q.10 fgrep
= fgrep is stands for fixed global regular expression print
= works like a grep -F
= it treats special character as normal text
= fast to fixed search text
= ex fgrep "a*b" f1

q.11 sed command
 = sed command is a command tool to replace,find,insert,append,print and delete the charcter or line without opening it
 = options with sed
 1. replace :- replace is used to replace a character
    ex . sed 's/unix/Linux/' f1
         sed 's/unix/Linux/g' f1

 2. print :- it is used to print the line
    ex . sed '3p' f1
         sed '3,7p' f1

 3. delete :- it is used to delete the line
    ex . sed '3d' f1

 4. insert :- it's insert a line before the given number
    ex . sed '3i hello' f1

 5. append :- it insert a line after the given number
    ex . sed '3a new' f1

q.12 explain Linux components
 = hardware :- physical components like a cpu, memory, disk, I/O device
 = kernel :- core of Linux, manage hardware, memory, block and I/O device
 = shell :- interpreter communication, let's user interact with kernel
 = GNU utility :- support basic command and tool for file and directory
 = application :- user interact like a browser, media player,servers

q.13 test statement:
 = test command is used to check condition such as a numeric, file permission, string comparison etc
 = it return 0 if file is satisfied otherwise it return 1
 = number comparison :- gt, ge, lt, le, eq, nq
 = string comparison :- str1=str2, str1==str2, -n str1=str2, -z str1=str2, str1!=str2
 = file permission :- r, w, e, s, d, l 

q.14 arithmetic operation 
= arithmethic operation can be done using expr and $(())
1.use of expr
= oldest version to use arithmetic operation
= require space between operator and operand
= ex. echo $ 5 + 3
2.use of $(())
= moden and easy
= support all arithmetic operations
= ex. echo $((5+3))
